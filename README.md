# Stranded_Game
This is a survival game created with 4-5 programmers. The map and asets were taken fromt he Unity asset store. 
I contributed in creating the enemy AI pattern.
Where the enemy has an area of "vision" around them, if the player were to enter the "vision" area, then the enemy will chase the player.
If the player are able to leave the vision area, the enemy will stop chasing them.
